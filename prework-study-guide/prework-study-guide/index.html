          <li>External CSS style sheet, allows developers to keep all their CSS rukes in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A Variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript, is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.</li>
          <li>Application Programming Interfaces, API, built into we browsers, providing functionality such asdynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a users webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li>Third Party API, allow developers to incorporate funcionality in sites from other content providers, such, as, Twitter or Facebook.</li>
          <li>Third party frameworks and libraries, can be applied to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
          <li>Var, used to describe a variable.</li>
          <li>=, assignment operator to assign the specific datathat we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>Console.log, output a message to the web consoleby creating an argument.</li>
          <li>Control flow, is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the top of the page, to the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>If statement, a way of introducing desicion-making into our code. Code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>Else if, used if there is more than one condition.</li>
          <li>The Strict Equality Operator, ===, checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result "true" if equal, or "false" if not equal.</li>
          <li>Array, a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of datas index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. The first item in any array has an index of 0 not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>For loop, uses the predictable pattern of indices to perfeorm a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over, and over.</li>
          <li>The length of an array can be found by using the built in, length, property.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements;</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Scince we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable of "x" and give it a value of "0".</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable "x" is less then the length of the array, the loop will keep running.</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code "x++" is a shortcut way of writting x+1. Now every time you code loops "x" will increase by 1.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code, makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. Put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>OOP, object oriented programming.</li>
          <li>Function, A function is different from a "for loop" or "conditional statement" because funtions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. A funtions name is followed by ().</li>
        </ul>
